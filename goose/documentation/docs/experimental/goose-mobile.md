Goose Mobile is an experimental Android project inspired by the Goose application. It acts as an open agent on your phone, automating multistep tasks, responding to notifications, and even replacing your home screen for maximum efficiency.

:::danger Experimental
Goose Mobile requires deep access to your device. Use at your own risk — best on a spare phone or emulator.

## What It Does
- **Automation:** Orchestrates tasks using your installed apps.
- **Notification Handling:** Responds to incoming notifications based on your rules.
- **Extensibility:** Leverages extensions from other apps to perform background tasks seamlessly.


## Installation
- **Pre-built APK:** Install quickly via [Firebase distribution link](https://appdistribution.firebase.google.com/pub/i/3f111ea732d5f7f6).
- **Build from Source:** Developer instructions are in the [Goose Mobile repository](https://github.com/block/goose-mobile).


## Extending Goose Mobile
Goose Mobile supports the **mobile MCP** system, which lets it use tools from other apps without leaving context — e.g., fetching weather data via a weather extension.  

Sample code and setup instructions are in the repository [README](https://github.com/block/goose-mobile).
