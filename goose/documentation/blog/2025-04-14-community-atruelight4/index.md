As the goose team continues to work on new features over 800 community members voted to express their need for Goose on Windows. Today's top contributor stepped in to aid this ongoing effort.

## Windows Support

Since the launch of codename goose, the open source community has been wanting and requesting the same automation by goose on Windows.

Currently, goose's CLI version works on Windows with limited built-in extensions via WSL, or Windows Subsystem for Linux. While there is a limited internal beta in the works, there are several bugs and improvements that are being worked on to ensure codename goose has the same seamless experience as it does on Mac.

## ATrueLight4's Goose4Win

Our featured contributor, [ATrueLight4](https://github.com/ATrueLight4), shipped **Goose4Win**, a fix that improves how Goose handles Windows-specific file paths. Their contribution is already merged into main, so if you install Goose for CLI on Windows today, youâ€™ll get the improvement out of the box. No extra setup needed.

Thank you so much for your contribution, ATrueLight4! Your work brings us one step closer to Goose on Windows.


To show our deep gratitude for your contribution, we've granted you the exclusive âœ¨Top Contributorâœ¨ badge on the Block Open Source Discord! You'll also be one of the first contributors to receive exclusive codename goose swag. (more info on that to be announced later ðŸ‘€ðŸª¿)
