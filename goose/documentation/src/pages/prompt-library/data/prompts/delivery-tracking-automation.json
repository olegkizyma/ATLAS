  "example_prompt": "Track the live GPS location of driver ID #{driver_id}. Query Google Maps for real-time traffic data and adjust the estimated delivery time if delays exceed 5 minutes. If ETA changes, update the customer's live tracker and send an SMS notification. If the delay is greater than 20 minutes, check if another driver within a 1-mile radius can take over the delivery.",
  "example_result": "I've analyzed the delivery route for driver #1234.
