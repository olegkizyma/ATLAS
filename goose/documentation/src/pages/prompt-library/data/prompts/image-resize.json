  "example_prompt": "Resize my image {image_path} to be {width}x{height} pixels. Maintain the aspect ratio and image quality.",
  "example_result": "I'll help you resize the image while maintaining its aspect ratio and quality. Here's what I'll do:\n\n1. Load and analyze the original image:\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\n\n# Open the image\nimg = Image.open('product_photo.jpg')\n\n# Get original dimensions\noriginal_width, original_height = img.size\nprint(f\"Original dimensions: {original_width}x{original_height}\")\n```\n\nOriginal dimensions: 2400x1600\n\n2. Calculate new dimensions preserving aspect ratio:\n```python\ntarget_width = 800\ntarget_height = 600\n\n# Calculate scaling factor\nwidth_ratio = target_width / original_width\nheight_ratio = target_height / original_height\nscale_factor = min(width_ratio, height_ratio)\n\n# Calculate new dimensions\nnew_width = int(original_width * scale_factor)\nnew_height = int(original_height * scale_factor)\n\nprint(f\"New dimensions: {new_width}x{new_height}\")\n```\n\nNew dimensions: 800x533\n\n3. Perform the resize operation:\n```python\n# Resize using high-quality Lanczos resampling\nresized_img = img.resize((new_width, new_height), Image.Resampling.LANCZOS)\n\n# Save with optimal quality settings\nresized_img.save(\n    'product_photo_resized.jpg',\n    'JPEG',\n    quality=95,\n    optimize=True\n)\n```\n\nImage has been resized and saved as 'product_photo_resized.jpg'\n\nResize Summary:\n- Original size: 2400x1600 pixels\n- Target size: 800x600 pixels\n- Final size: 800x533 pixels\n- Aspect ratio: Maintained (1.5:1)\n- Resampling: Lanczos (high quality)\n- Format: JPEG\n- Quality: 95%\n- Optimization: Enabled\n\nThe image has been resized to fit within the requested dimensions while maintaining its original proportions. I used Lanczos resampling for the highest quality output and saved with optimal JPEG compression settings to preserve image quality.\n\nWould you like me to show you a preview of the resized image?",
