  "example_prompt": "Goose, learn these security vulnerability patterns and their relationships:\n\n1. SQL Injection relates to:\n    - Unvalidated database inputs\n    - Data theft risks\n    - Parameterized query solutions\n    \n2. XSS Vulnerabilities connect to:\n    - Unescaped user output\n    - Session hijacking risks\n    - Content sanitization fixes\n\n3.Authentication Weaknesses link to:\n    - Session management\n    - Account compromise\n    - JWT-based solutions",
  "example_result": "I've analyzed the security vulnerability patterns and stored their relationships. Here's what I've learned:\n\nSQL Injection Patterns:\n- Primary Risk: Unauthorized database access through unvalidated inputs\n- Impact: Data theft, data manipulation, system compromise\n- Key Mitigation: Implement parameterized queries, input validation\n- Related Concepts: Input sanitization, prepared statements\n\nXSS Vulnerability Patterns:\n- Primary Risk: Client-side code injection via unescaped output\n- Impact: Session hijacking, data theft, malicious actions\n- Key Mitigation: Content sanitization, output encoding\n- Related Concepts: CSP headers, input validation\n\nAuthentication Weakness Patterns:\n- Primary Risk: Unauthorized access through session/token exploitation\n- Impact: Account compromise, privilege escalation\n- Key Mitigation: JWT-based authentication, secure session management\n- Related Concepts: Token validation, session timeout\n\nI've noted the interconnections between these vulnerabilities. Would you like me to analyze any specific relationship in more detail?",
