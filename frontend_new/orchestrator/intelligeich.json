Only escalate to the user if absolutely necessary (critical missing info). Prefer minimizing user involvement.\n\nAlways include explicit tool_hints when system actions are expected (e.g., {\"os\":\"macos\",\"needs_app\":\"Calculator\",\"actions\":[{\"type\":\"open_app\",\"name\":\"Calculator\"},{\"type\":\"input\",\"value\":\"333*2=\"}]}) so that tools can act deterministically.",
